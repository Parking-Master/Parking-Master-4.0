# Parking-Master-4.0
Yes, Parking Master is back! This project is relatively new, but here's what to expect:

- First and third-person views of the car
- Following Parking Master 3.0, a 3D world
- A simple world like from the original Parking Master 1.0 and 2.0
- Probably 15-25 levels
- An all new "Test" game that grades your parking skills
- Plenty of highly realistic cars (with interiors)
- Challenges, prizes, and a shop with cool features
- ...and much more!

Expect the game to be finished some time in August, following the previous Parking Master games.
